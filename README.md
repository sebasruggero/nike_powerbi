Nike Data Analysis Project


In this Power BI project focused on the renowned brand Nike, I utilized publicly available datasets and employed Deneb for analyzing and visualizing key insights. The project was meticulously crafted with a strong emphasis on enhancing the user experience. Through dynamic dashboards and interactive reports, my goal was to provide a comprehensive view of Nike's performance, market trends, and consumer engagement.

By harnessing the power of data, the project not only offers valuable business intelligence but also ensures a smooth and insightful experience for users navigating through the visualizations.
